		<h2>&#9733; About Me! &#9733;</h2>
	
		<div class = "textcenter">
		<div class = "padding250">
		<p>I am a fourth-year computer science student studying for my Bachelor's in Computer Science at California State University, Fullerton. 
		I am also pursuing an Associate's in Computer Maintenance Technology, Software Specialist, and Cyber Defense.
		My passion for technology began at 13, when I started building computers on my own. Since then, I have developed a strong understanding of 
		both hardware and software. I love using my knowledge to help others––whether this be building a friend's computer, troubleshooting hardware/software issues, 
		or educating people about computer technology. I am a very hard worker and am extremely determined to grow in the computer science field. Coding quickly became 
		a natural fit for me–I love the challenge of solving problems and the satisfaction of completing projects. I am incredibly intrigued in learning new languages and 
		am eager to know more. In a team environment, I bring strong determination and a drive to continuously improve. I would love to be able to apply my skills in roles 
		that would allow me to constantly be learning and helping others. In my own time, I love to make art, play video games, and help animals and people in need. 
		Sometimes I even incorporate these hobbies into my projects! I am extremely excited to connect with those who share a similar passion as I and can not wait 
		to contribute to impactful projects and grow in this field.</p>
